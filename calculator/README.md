### 🧮 Calculator

A button-based calculator built using **HTML and Vanilla JavaScript**, focused on **expression logic and DOM handling**.

**Note:** CSS is template / AI-assisted; all HTML and JavaScript code is written manually.

#### Features
- Basic arithmetic: `+ − × ÷ %`
- Power operation using `^`
- Brackets `( )` support
- Decimal numbers
- Backspace and clear
- Mathematical constant **π (pi)**
- Automatic multiplication handling:
  - `2(3)` → `2*(3)`  
  - `5π` → `5*π`

#### Logic Highlights
- Button-controlled input (read-only display)
- Converts `^` to `**` and `π` to `Math.PI` before evaluation
- Error handling using `try–catch` to prevent crashes
- Smart input logic to handle numbers after `)` or before `π`

#### Tech Focus
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- Expression building and evaluation logic

#### Status
Learning-phase project (no further planned updates)
