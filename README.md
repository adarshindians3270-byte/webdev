# Frontend Learning Projects

This repository contains small frontend projects built during my learning phase.
The focus is on understanding **HTML structure, JavaScript logic, and DOM behavior**
using **Vanilla JavaScript**.

Projects here are created to explore concepts step-by-step rather than to build
fully polished products.

## Purpose
- Learn core web fundamentals
- Practice JavaScript logic and DOM manipulation
- Understand browser APIs and event handling
- Build functional UI behavior without frameworks

## Tech Stack
- HTML5
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS (manual in some projects, template / AI-assisted in others)

## Projects

### 🌍 World Clock
- Displays current time for selected time zones
- Uses JavaScript Date API
- Dynamic DOM updates
- Event-driven UI logic

### 🧮 Calculator
- Button-based calculator
- Supports arithmetic operations, brackets, power (`^`), and π
- Automatic multiplication handling (e.g. `2(3)`, `5π`)
- Expression evaluation with input validation and error handling

## Notes
- No frameworks or libraries are used
- Each project focuses on a specific concept
- UI design is intentionally kept simple
- Older projects may not receive further updates

## Status
Learning phase — projects are built for practice and understanding.
